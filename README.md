# Mapping the Bitcoin Investment Theses


We can classify the investment theses for (and against) investing in Bitcoin into categories. This helps clarify how much of an impact a given narrative could have to Bitcoin's valuation. 

![Categorized Bitcoin Investment Theses](https://github.com/PierreRochard/bitcoin-investment-theses/blob/master/categorized_theses_chart.png "Categorized Bitcoin Investment Theses")


## A. Short holding period, high adoption

### 1. Retail payments
Thesis: Bitcoin, whether it's on-chain, off-chain, or Lightning, will supplant 
current retail payment methods including cash, checks, and credit cards. 
Bitcoin's advantage over cash and checks is that it is digital, the consumer 
only needs a smartphone and the retailer does not have to worry about handling 
cash or depositing checks. Bitcoin's advantage over credit cards is lower 
transaction fees, irreversibility which protects the merchant, and a "push" 
system with no credit card numbers - which protects the consumer. Fast 
settlement means that merchants require less in working capital.

Anti-thesis: Reversibility increases consumer confidence. A "pull" system 
enables subscriptions which are an important business model. On-chain 
transactions can not scale without centralizing the Bitcoin network. Off-chain 
and layer 2 transactions have an up-hill battle against entrenched debit and 
credit card payment systems. Credit cards give consumers flexibility in 
financing their purchases. Consumers who acquire bitcoins with the intent of 
making retail payments end up just holding the bitcoins for price appreciation
instead.

### 2. Micropayments
Thesis: Bitcoin's Lightning network enables instant, high-volume micropayments.
Micropayments will be leveraged by online games, content publishers, and social 
media tipping services to monetize interactions and consumption.

Anti-thesis: Subscriptions provide a better revenue model for content publishers
and social media tipping ignores why people actually engage with each other.
Game creators and players currently have no serious issues with in-game 
purchases. If there are any complaints it's from players who feel 
nickel-and-dimed, which would only be worse with micropayments.

### 3. Machine-to-machine payments
Thesis: The Internet of Things (IoT) means that your refrigerator could 
communicate with several grocery business APIs to negotiate for the best value
replenishment. Soon the grocery business itself will automatically be 
negotiating with self-driving cars providing delivery services. This network of 
machine-to-machine payments will all be with Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

Anti-thesis: Even if machines are negotiating with each other for goods and 
services, it's unclear why the businesses which own them would not invoice 
each other on a monthly basis instead of continuously streaming payments. 
Companies will continue to keep track of their payables and receivables, and 
netting them out for payment, in which case Bitcoin is not a necessity. Today 
Amazon Web Services charges by the second, can be controlled by an API, but 
payments are made monthly with fiat-denominated credit cards, wire transfers, or
ACH.

### 4. International remittances

Thesis: Money transfers between countries are expensive and slow, Bitcoin can 
make them fast and cheap. Anyone, anywhere in the world who has an internet 
connection can receive bitcoins. 

Anti-thesis: Senders want to send their local fiat currency and recipients want 
to receive their local fiat currency. Neither side has bitcoins. Using Bitcoin 
means adding an FX conversion on the sender's side and on the recipient's side, 
this inherently increases cost. The cost of sending $200 anywhere in the world 
has declined from 10% in 2008 to 7% in 2017. Money transfers are expensive due 
to physical locations, marketing, licensing, and compliance. Bitcoin on its own 
does not solve any of those issues. The slow fiat payment rails are being 
improved by fintech startups using fiat banks and SQL databases. 

## B. Short holding period, low adoption

### 1. Tax evasion

Thesis: Just as restaurant waiters can under-report their cash tips, a person or 
business receiving bitcoin revenues could under-report them. There is no 
financial institution which the IRS can subpoena for records. If the tax 
evader is careful about how they use Bitcoin's public blockchain ledger then 
they can also avoid being caught with data analysis.

Anti-thesis: Tax auditors have experts in computer forensics and there's always
a paper trail for the creation and sale of a good or service. It would be risky 
and time consuming to convert the proceeds into fiat. Tax evasion does not scale 
due to whistle-blowers, reporting by third parties (1099's in the US), and the 
lifestyle/income mismatch.

### 2. Black markets

Thesis: Before it was shutdown in 2013, the Silk Road was a marketplace for 
illegal drugs. It had tens of thousands of users and $22 million in annual 
sales. In 2017, a successor of the Silk Road called AlphaBay was also shut down,
it was ten times the size of the Silk Road with hundreds of thousands of users.
Bitcoin enables the sales of illegal goods and services because it is a 
permissionless, censorship-resistant payments network.

Anti-thesis: Ultimately most goods and services have to be delivered in the 
real world, so even if the payment is pseudonymous the delivery can reveal the 
identities of buyers and sellers. Additionally, even if the bitcoins are bought 
and sold in person for fiat cash, there is a risk that the bitcoin broker is an 
informant or government agent. Buying and selling bitcoins on an online 
exchange with KYC/AML is even riskier. This problem is compounded by the 
visibility of on-chain Bitcoin transactions.


### 3. Ransomware

Thesis: Ransomware is when malicious software encrypts a user's data, locking 
them out of personal or business information. The virus demands payment in 
bitcoins to decrypt the data. 

Anti-thesis: Increasing awareness of the problem is leading to effective 
mitigation strategies, whether with anti-virus software or offline data backups. 

### 4. Online gambling

Thesis: While online poker is legal in the United States, in practice the 
Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 made it illegal for 
financial institutions to service online poker platforms and players. This 
eventually led to the wide usage of Bitcoin for funding online poker games. The 
phenomenon has expanded beyond poker, there are Bitcoin-funded sites for sports 
betting, blackjack, dice, and slots. 

Anti-thesis: If US legislation changes to be more favorable towards online 
gambling then this niche for Bitcoin could disappear.

### 5. Unbanked businesses

Thesis: Payment processors and banks are facing pressure to not service 
businesses for political reasons. These businesses include gun stores, 
marijuana dispensaries, and sex workers. Other businesses and individuals do 
not have access to banking services due to redlining or credit history. 
A Bitcoin wallet enables these demographics to "be their own bank" with a 
checking account and the ability to send and receive payments.

Anti-thesis: As long as the rest of the economy is using fiat currencies, the 
unbanked still need a way to exchange their bitcoins for fiat. They can use 
in-person cash exchange services, though there are cases of people being 
robbed and it is not a scalable solution for anything but the smallest business.

### 5. Speculative trading

Thesis: Bitcoin exchanges are open for trading 24/7. On top of Bitcoin's 
volatility, they also offer up to 100x leverage. Tech-savvy traders are 
building bots that use the exchanges' public APIs to execute their strategies.
The execution engines of exchanges are moving from AWS to dedicated hosting, 
in the same facilities where US equities trade. Exchanges are the most 
profitable businesses in the Bitcoin ecosystem, offering both spot and futures 
products. Speculators can now profit both by going long and going short. 
The limited supply of bitcoins has led to repeated speculative frenzies, where 
fortunes have been made and lost. 

Anti-thesis: Speculation is zero-sum, eventually bad traders will run out of 
capital and good traders will see diminishing profits and move to greener 
pastures. Bitcoin's volatility has been decreasing as its liquidity increases. 
The markets are manipulated to favor whales and they will be shutdown or become 
boring when government regulators intervene to stop manipulation. The 
speculative frenzies are faked by wash-trading volume and fractional reserve 
exchanges. 

### 6. Ponzi scheme

Thesis: While Bitcoin may not fit the definition of an actual Ponzi scheme, it 
has a lot of similarity with one, Preston Byrne popularized the concept of a 
[Nakamoto Scheme](https://prestonbyrne.com/2017/12/08/bitcoin_ponzi/). Early 
buyers of bitcoins recruit and sell to later buyers, at ever higher prices. The 
cries to "HODL" are just to prop up the price and keep the scheme from falling 
apart due to the equivalent of a bank-run. "Tulips" and "greater fool theory" 
are used as shorthand for this thesis. Once the number of gullible buyers runs 
out then the price will crash as everyone tries to get out at the same time. 

Anti-thesis: Every money is a bubble, a shared illusion, an inter-subjective 
[Schelling point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_point_(game_theory)) of 
which unproductive asset is best suited to be society's medium of exchange, 
store of value, and unit of account. Bitcoin is bootstrapping to potentially 
fill that role from a value of zero. This has led to an astounding run-up in 
its fiat price. What goes unexplained in the Ponzi scheme thesis is why 
severe drawdowns (most recently a 91% peak to trough drawdown in 2014) are not 
a deathblow. So far, the value of bitcoins recovers and ultimately increases 
beyond the previous all time high. 

### 7. Money laundering

Thesis: Corrupt politicians who were bribed with bitcoins want to convert them 
into legitimate assets without raising suspicions. The money launderer can 
take advantage of Bitcoin's fragmented market by sending small amounts to many 
different exchanges to sell for fiat, a form of structuring. A money launderer 
can also mix the illegal Bitcoin revenues with legal Bitcoin revenues, for 
example from an online poker business they control or partner with. A growing 
strategy is purchasing property with bitcoins, and then selling the property 
for fiat. 

Anti-thesis: Any involvement of Bitcoin raises suspicion, so laundering 
bitcoins is ultimately harder than laundering fiat. 
[Data indicates](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-laundering-study-where-do-criminals-turn-mask-illicit-cryptoassets/)
that Bitcoin money laundering has been an increasingly marginal activity. 
Bitcoin faces stiff competition from large international banks, which continue 
to be the go-to providers of money laundering services. 


### 8. Routing around capital controls

Thesis: Countries which have a currency peg, like China, have to rely on 
capital controls to prevent their currency's exchange rate from appreciating or 
depreciating in an unexpected manner. For example, Chinese citizens can only 
purchase up to $50,000 of foreign currency per year. Chinese regulators have 
also recently prevented offshore investments into U.S. real estate. Bitcoin 
allows people to route around capital controls, by buying bitcoins locally, 
sending them to an exchange abroad, and selling them for the foreign currency.

Anti-thesis: While Bitcoin can help small-scale evasion of capital controls, 
it is not liquid enough to capture market share from other forms of evasion. 
Governments have and will crackdown on their local Bitcoin exchanges to further 
reduce liquidity. 

### 9. FOMO buyers

Thesis: Retail investors see the price going up and experience a "fear of 
missing out" on further price gains and the social phenomenon. Individuals 
want to be able to relate to each other, if your friends are talking about 
investing in Bitcoin then you feel a need to do so yourself. When the price 
stops going up parabolically the social fad quickly passes. Conversation turns 
to embarrassing losses and moves on to the next trendy investment.

Anti-thesis: The FOMO buyers become FOCO (fear of cashing out) holders. They 
sit on the bitcoins they impulsively bought, waiting for the next bubble. A 
certain percentage of them start to actually research what Bitcoin is and 
continue accumulating during the bear market. 

### 10. Vehicle Currency

Thesis: In 1979 Paul Krugman published a paper titled "Vehicle Currencies and 
the Structure of International Exchange". In this paper he explained that 
"People who want to exchange one currency for another will not necessarily make 
the exchange directly. They may make the exchange by way of some third 
currency, which becomes a "vehicle" for the transaction. Historically, certain 
currencies — the pound sterling before 1914, the U.S. dollar in recent years — 
have come to be widely used as vehicle currencies." Bitcoin has the potential 
to become the vehicle currency of international trade.

Anti-thesis: Bitcoin is not nearly liquid enough to be a vehicle currency. 
Competing with the U.S. dollar for this is extremely difficult, the most 
likely candidate has been the euro and it has made little progress.

### 11. Electricity monetization

Thesis: Governments and individuals that are struggling to get hard currency 
can use cheap local electricity to mine for bitcoins. The Venezuelan government 
has been seizing imported Bitcoin mining equipment so that they can use it 
themselves. The North Korean government acquired 11,000 bitcoins through a 
combination of mining and hacking.

Anti-thesis: As Bitcoin mining finds increasingly inexpensive sources of 
electricity, it will become less and less profitable for governments to mine 
even if they have favorable access to fossil fuels.
