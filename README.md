# Mapping the Bitcoin Investment Theses


We can classify the investment theses for (and against) investing in Bitcoin into categories. This helps clarify how much of an impact a given narrative could have to Bitcoin's valuation. 

![Categorized Bitcoin Investment Theses](https://github.com/PierreRochard/bitcoin-investment-theses/blob/master/categorized_theses_chart.png "Categorized Bitcoin Investment Theses")


## A. Short holding period, high adoption

### 1. Retail payments
Thesis: Bitcoin, whether it's on-chain, off-chain, or Lightning, will supplant 
current retail payment methods including cash, checks, and credit cards. 
Bitcoin's advantage over cash and checks is that it is digital, the consumer 
only needs a smartphone and the retailer does not have to worry about handling 
cash or depositing checks. Bitcoin's advantage over credit cards is lower 
transaction fees, irreversibility which protects the merchant, and a "push" 
system with no credit card numbers - which protects the consumer. Fast 
settlement means that merchants require less in working capital.

Anti-thesis: Reversibility increases consumer confidence. A "pull" system 
enables subscriptions which are an important business model. On-chain 
transactions can not scale without centralizing the Bitcoin network. Off-chain 
and layer 2 transactions have an up-hill battle against entrenched debit and 
credit card payment systems. Credit cards give consumers flexibility in 
financing their purchases. Consumers who acquire bitcoins with the intent of 
making retail payments end up just holding the bitcoins for price appreciation
instead.

### 2. Micropayments
Thesis: Bitcoin's Lightning network enables instant, high-volume micropayments.
Micropayments will be leveraged by online games, content publishers, and social 
media tipping services to monetize interactions and consumption.

Anti-thesis: Subscriptions provide a better revenue model for content publishers
and social media tipping ignores why people actually engage with each other.
Game creators and players currently have no serious issues with in-game 
purchases. If there are any complaints it's from players who feel 
nickel-and-dimed, which would only be worse with micropayments.

### 3. Machine-to-machine payments
Thesis: The Internet of Things (IoT) means that your refrigerator could 
communicate with several grocery business APIs to negotiate for the best value
replenishment. Soon the grocery business itself will automatically be 
negotiating with self-driving cars providing delivery services. This network of 
machine-to-machine payments will all be with Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

Anti-thesis: Even if machines are negotiating with each other for goods and 
services, it's unclear why the businesses which own them would not invoice 
each other on a monthly basis instead of continuously streaming payments. 
Companies will continue to keep track of their payables and receivables, and 
netting them out for payment, in which case Bitcoin is not a necessity. Today 
Amazon Web Services charges by the second, can be controlled by an API, but 
payments are made monthly with fiat-denominated credit cards, wire transfers, or
ACH.

### 4. International remittances

Thesis: Money transfers between countries are expensive and slow, Bitcoin can 
make them fast and cheap. Anyone, anywhere in the world who has an internet 
connection can receive bitcoins. 

Anti-thesis: Senders want to send their local fiat currency and recipients want 
to receive their local fiat currency. Neither side has bitcoins. Using Bitcoin 
means adding an FX conversion on the sender's side and on the recipient's side, 
this inherently increases cost. The cost of sending $200 anywhere in the world 
has declined from 10% in 2008 to 7% in 2017. Money transfers are expensive due 
to physical locations, marketing, licensing, and compliance. Bitcoin on its own 
does not solve any of those issues. The slow fiat payment rails are being 
improved by fintech startups using fiat banks and SQL databases. 

## B. Short holding period, low adoption

### 1. Tax evasion

Thesis: Just as restaurant waiters can under-report their cash tips, a person or 
business receiving bitcoin revenues could under-report them. There is no 
financial institution which the IRS can subpoena for records. If the tax 
evader is careful about how they use Bitcoin's public blockchain ledger then 
they can also avoid being caught with data analysis.

Anti-thesis: Tax auditors have experts in computer forensics and there's always
a paper trail for the creation and sale of a good or service. It would be risky 
and time consuming to convert the proceeds into fiat. Tax evasion does not scale 
due to whistle-blowers, reporting by third parties (1099's in the US), and the 
lifestyle/income mismatch.
