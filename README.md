# Mapping the Bitcoin Investment Theses


We can classify the investment theses for (and against) investing in Bitcoin into categories. This helps clarify how much of an impact a given narrative could have to Bitcoin's valuation.

## A. Short holding period, high adoption

### 1. Retail payments
Thesis: Bitcoin, whether it's on-chain, off-chain, or layer 2, will supplant current retail payment methods including cash, checks, and credit cards. Bitcoin's advantage over cash and checks is that it is digital, the consumer only needs a smartphone and the retailer does not have to worry about handling cash or depositing checks. Bitcoin's advantage over credit cards is lower transaction fees, irreversibility which protects the merchant, and a "push" system with no credit card numbers - which protects the consumer.

Anti-thesis: Reversibility increases consumer confidence. A "pull" system enables subscriptions which are an important business model. On-chain transactions can not scale without centralizing the Bitcoin network. Off-chain and layer 2 transactions have an up-hill battle against entrenched debit and credit card payment systems. Credit cards give consumers flexibility in financing their purchases.
